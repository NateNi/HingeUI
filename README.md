# Hinge 2022 Messaging UI

This small project was created to replicate the Hinge messaging UI. I wanted to preserve the first conversations I ever had with my girlfriend, long after deleting the app. So I requested my data from the official app and designed this as a Valentines gift.

Selecting the arrow in the top left corner switches toggles the view from each person's perspective.  Clicking on the three dots in the top right displays a hidden valentines day message popup.

Designed for mobile only. Placeholders are provided for the images and text.
